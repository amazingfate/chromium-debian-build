description: fix bindgen-related stuff

Two separate but related fixes:

Crabbyav1f is calling bindgen features which are not currently in
bookworm or sid; --allowlist-item was added in bindgen 0.68. As far
as I can tell the build.rs stuff calls allowlist_item from there as
well, so these arguments may just be redundant? Hopefully I'm not
breaking stuff..  Drop this for sid once bindgen gets upgraded.


Also, the call to bindgen sets the path for libclang to
rust_bindgen_root, which is wrong. We're already passing
clang_base_path with the path to libclang, there's no reason that
we'd expect libclang to be in the same directory as bindgen. That
fix should probably go upstream.
